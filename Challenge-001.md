# Challenge 001 

Create your Shardnet wallet & deploy the NEAR CLI. This is designed to be your very first challenge: use it to understand how staking on NEAR works.

NEAR-CLI is a command-line interface that communicates with the NEAR blockchain via remote procedure calls (RPC):

* Setup and Installation NEAR CLI

* View Validator Stats

## 1. Create a wallet on ShardNet 

Go to https://wallet.shardnet.near.org/ .create wallet choose your name and save seed phrase. This walled will be used to hold NEAR tokens.


## 2. Setup NEAR-CLI

*If you use cloud providers to run your node please refer [Challenge 005](https://github.com/duongthanhmy91/stakewars-iii/blob/main/Challenges-005.md) first*

Access to server via SSH and do the below commands: 

*# Update linux machine*
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

*# Install Node.js and npm*
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -  
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs -y
PATH="$PATH"
```
*#Check version*

*# Install NEAR-CLI, you can use sudo that help without logged in as root* 
```
sudo npm install -g near-cli
```

*# Select the shardnet network ( this is the network we will use for Stake Wars ). This command will put it to .bashrc and these variables will loading automatically for every new terminal session.*
```
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=shardnet' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
## NEAR CLI Commands Guide:

We ready to execute some commands, letâ€™s see how works.

*# Proposals*

A proposal by a validator indicates they would like to enter the validator set, in order for a proposal to be accepted it must meet the minimum seat price.
