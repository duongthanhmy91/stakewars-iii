**Deploy a Staking Pool**

Calls the staking pool factory, creates a new staking pool with the specified name, and deploys it to the indicated accountId.

```
near call factory.shardnet.near create_staking_pool '{"staking_pool_id": "<pool id>", "owner_id": "<accountId>", "stake_public_key": "<public_key>", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 5, "denominator": 100}, "code_hash":"DD428g9eqLL8fWUxv8QSpVFzyHi1Qd16P8ephYCTmMSZ"}' --accountId="<accountId>" --amount=30 --gas=300000000000000
```
Be sure to have at least 30 NEAR available, it is the minimum required for storage.

**Staking to the pool**
```
near call <pool_id> deposit_and_stake --amount <NEAR amount> --accountId <account_id> --gas=300000000000000
```

Example : 


To change the pool parameters, such as changing the amount of commission charged to 1% in the example below, use this command:
```
near call <pool_name> update_reward_fee_fraction '{"reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 1, "denominator": 100}}' --accountId <account_id> --gas=300000000000000
```


You will see something like this:
